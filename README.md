📝 Project Description.

## This project is a Java Swing Desktop Application designed to manage data efficiently in a chosen domain. It integrates JDBC for database connectivity, RegEx for data validation, and demonstrates clear Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

## he application allows users to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on a database using a friendly graphical interface built with Java Swing.

## For demonstration purposes, the domain selected is Student Management, but the architecture can be extended to other domains like Library Management, Employee Records, or Inventory Management.

## ⚡ Features

Graphical User Interface (GUI) using Java Swing:

## Main user interface window

Input forms for adding or updating data

## Buttons for Add, View/Load, Update, Delete, and Clear

## Display records in a JTable

Uses at least 5 Swing components: JLabel, JTextField, JButton, JTable, JScrollPane, JComboBox

Database Integration (JDBC):

MySQL database connectivity

PreparedStatement used for all queries

Handles database exceptions properly

SQL file included for easy database creation

## CRUD Operations:

## Create: Insert valid records

## Read: Display all records in JTable

## Update: Modify selected records

## Delete: Remove selected entries

## OOP Principles:

Encapsulation: Private fields with getters and setters

Inheritance / Interfaces: Used in service and model layers

Abstraction: Implemented using interfaces and abstract classes

Separation of concerns: Organized in packages:

/model – Data models

/db – Database connection and setup

/service – CRUD operations and business logic

/ui – Swing GUI classes

Data Validation:

Uses RegEx to validate inputs (e.g., email format, phone number, ID)

Error Handling:

Proper exception handling and user-friendly error messages

## 🛠️ Technical Requirements

Java Swing for GUI

JDBC for database operations

RegEx for input validation

MySQL database

Proper OOP design

Clean code with comments



## 💻 Notes

The project uses PreparedStatement to prevent SQL injection.

GUI forms are designed for ease of use and error prevention.

The structure is easily extensible for other domains like Library or Employee Management.
